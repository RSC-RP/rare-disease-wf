```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

If you haven't already, set up a directory to store singularity images that you
have downloaded.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mkdir -p ~/singularity
```

Navigate there and download the image for Somalier.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ~/singularity

module load singularity

singularity pull docker://brentp/somalier
```

Now you can give it a quick test to see that you have access to the software.

```{bashm eval = FALSE}
singularity exec ~/singularity/somalier_latest.sif somalier extract --help
```
