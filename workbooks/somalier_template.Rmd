```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

If you haven't already, set up a directory to store singularity images that you
have downloaded.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mkdir -p ~/singularity
```

Navigate there and download the image for Somalier.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd ~/singularity

module load singularity

singularity pull docker://brentp/somalier
```

Now you can give it a quick test to see that you have access to the software.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
singularity exec ~/singularity/somalier_latest.sif somalier extract --help
```

## Check reference genome

Somalier needs a VCF file listing what sites it should use. The file should
match the reference genome for your BAMs or VCF.  Here is how we can check
a BAM file:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
module load SAMtools

export BAMPATH=/gpfs/shared_data/GIAB/OsloUniversityHospital_Exome

samtools view -H $BAMPATH/151002_7001448_0359_AC7F6GANXX_Sample_HG002-EEogPU_v02-KIT-Av5_AGATGTAC_L008.posiSrt.markDup.bam
```

In the output from `samtools view`, we can see that the chromosome names are
integers without the "chr" in front of them, and in the `bwa` line there is a
reference genome listed as `human_g1k_v37_decoy.fasta`.
If you don't have BAM files and are instead starting from a VCF, you can use
`zless` if it is gzipped, or `less` if it is not compressed, to similarly
preview the header to look at chromosome names and reference genome.

If you go to https://github.com/brentp/somalier/releases you can see VCFs to
download containing sites to use.  I know from the "v37" in our reference genome
name that we are using hg19/GRCh37.  I'm not sure which one from the page is
correct so I will download them both and look at them.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
mkdir -p ~/somalier

cd ~/somalier

wget https://github.com/brentp/somalier/files/3412453/sites.hg19.vcf.gz
wget https://github.com/brentp/somalier/files/3412455/sites.GRCh37.vcf.gz

gunzip -c sites.hg19.vcf.gz | grep contig | less
gunzip -c sites.GRCh37.vcf.gz | grep contig | less
```

Both actually have the "chr" in front of the chromosome name, so we will have to
modify one in order to use it. We can change them over with `bcftools annotate`.
There is a handy repo at https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings with
files that we can use to translate chromosome names.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
wget https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings/raw/master/GRCh37_UCSC2ensembl.txt

head GRCh37_UCSC2ensembl.txt

module load BCFtools

bcftools annotate --rename-chrs GRCh37_UCSC2ensembl.txt \
-o sites.hg19_ensembl.vcf.gz -O z \
sites.hg19.vcf.gz

gunzip -c sites.hg19_ensembl.vcf.gz | grep contig | less
```
